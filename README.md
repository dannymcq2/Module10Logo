# Module10Logo
# <Logo-Generator >

## Description

My motivation to create this was to give a simple solution for a simple logo that someone needs quickly.
I built this to help anyone in need of a logo or may need a template for ideas. 
This problem solves if someone may not be able to create a logo themselves or know anyone who can.
I learned more about being able to work on generators to use.
